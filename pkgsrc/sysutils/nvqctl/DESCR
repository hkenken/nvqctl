nvqctl is a lightweight CLI tool for managing QEMU virtual machines with
NVMM hardware acceleration on NetBSD. Inspired by Xen's xl and OpenBSD's
vmctl.

Features:
- Zero dependencies beyond NetBSD base system + QEMU
- Multiple VM management with per-VM configuration files
- Graceful shutdown via guest-agent, ACPI, or QMP
- Serial console and QMP monitor access
- rc.d integration for auto-start/stop VMs at boot
- VirtIO-first: virtio-blk, virtio-net, virtio-rng
- Pure POSIX sh, no additional interpreters required
